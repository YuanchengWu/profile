  "about.paragraph2": "I owe my life to the Internet. Without its existence, I never would have studied and lived outside of China, learned to speak English, made diverse friends, became a US citizen, studied in various schools and universities, found my wife, and learned to code. I may not always dedicate myself to creating software for the web, but for now, I am truly fortunate to have this realm as my career and playground.",

  "info.logo.subtitle": "My Name",
  "info.logo.subtitle.p1": "It’s related to my name. Not “John”, my Chinese given name 远骋 (pinyin: yuǎn chěng), which literally means, per character, “far away” and “gallop”. I was born and raised in mainland China, and I was given this name because my father aimed to bring his career and our family’s lives outside of China, mainly to the US.",
  "info.logo.subtitle.p2": "In addition, Chinese culture has an obsession with zodiac signs. Mine happens to be horse (birth year: 1990). My parents cleverly chose the somewhat sophisticated and highly obscure character 骋 as part of my name to both contain the character for horse (马) and contribute to the meaning. This lead to teachers frequently mispronouncing my name, both Chinese and American alike. To make matters worse, the English phonetic for (远) “yuan” looks suspiciously like the common Spanish name Juan, leading to people calling me “Juan-cheng” (I don’t blame them, what kind of word has “y”, “u”, and “a”, what are practically all vowels, consecutively‽). Not to mention the omission of Chinese tones. Consequentially, I did not like my name.",
  "info.logo.subtitle2": "Reconciliation",
  "info.logo.subtitle2.p1": "As I began to brainstorm the logo design, I realized that my name parallels well with my current attitude towards my path to be a worthy developer/programmer. A full gallop, to a knowledge and skill ceiling far away... A horse in motion seemed fitting. What about the brackets? They are a prominent part of C based code syntax. Plus, I dunno, I thought they looked stylish.",
  "info.style.title": "Style",
  "info.style.subtitle": "Inspiration",
  "info.style.subtitle.p1": "My love of graphical user interfaces (GUI) started in video games. Growing up, I was the weird kid who liked to explore the menus, tweak the options, instead of just starting the game. Video game menus are frequently overlooked pieces of great UX/UI engineering. This site design is heavily based on one of my childhood favorite games with a fantastic UI: {link}.",
  "info.style.subtitle2": "Prototyping",
  "info.style.subtitle2.p1": "I made Sketch my tool of choice for high fidelity prototyping due to its growing popularity among UI designers. After learning a few concepts such as style guides, the 8 point grid, and theming, I have a work-in-progress prototype on my {link}.",
  "info.code.title": "Code",
  "info.code.subtitle": "Philosophy",
  "info.code.subtitle.p1": "I want to practice writing {clean} and {DRY} code. Unfortunately, this code base is an example of neither. I will improve! Also, I want to have minimum dependencies. Using Create React App for React is already dependency heavy, so I try to keep the list from growing longer. Lastly, I’m a sucker for new technologies and methodologies. I like to explore experimental features and APIs. It can be challenging due to fewer online discussions, but I like challenges!",
  "info.code.subtitle2": "React",
  "info.code.subtitle2.p1": "Besides the need for a personal website, this is an excuse to practice building web apps with React. While learning React from the official documentation, I learned about {Hooks}. Although the concept isn’t heavily required for a static website, I enjoyed the new perspective on components during development after having just learned lifecycle methods. However, I have yet to create a successful version of my Typer component (for animating typing) with Hooks! I won’t give up!",
